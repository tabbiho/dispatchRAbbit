Rocket Academy Bootcamp Project 2: Server-Side App

A quick & lightweight delivery support app that manages delivery functions in a business that require specialised expertise, and hence are not able to engage traditional delivery partners. Post-transaction, admins (data entry) will create orders on the platform and assign them accordingly to a delivery staff, who will then proceed to perform their deliveries and mark them complete as and when delivery has been performed. Admins (managers) will then be able to monitor delivery progress as the day goes and intervene when necessary.
